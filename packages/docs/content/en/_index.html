## What is XR3ngine?
XR3ngine is an Open Source Web based 3D Social platform with AR/VR support.

Speakers and organizers can easily create calendars for events with Performances, Screenings, Talks, Expos, Workshops, and Mixers. 

XR3ngine will allow broadcasting of events such as talks and panels through Video and Desktop Sharing in 2D and 3D.

## Who made XR3ngine?

We collaboratively, design, build and maintain the project. On top of our own programming we currently each pay individuals to add features and solve issues. In the next few weeks we will be moving the project over to https://opencollective.com/ to better govern, scale and maintain collaboration.

Currently, Shaw Walters and Liam Broza steward XR3ngine as an open source project hosted on GitHub.
