Wallet Benefits
* Users now have a single place to store avatars (in their Solid storage pods), which is safely available to all participating servers
* * Single sign-on (we can still do emailing login links, etc) everywhere
User has a choice in wallet providers and storage providers

Risks / Downsides
* This tech, although on W3C standards track, is still raw / early
* Possibly too many clicks?
